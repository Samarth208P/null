  ['Do my users have to visit the NULL app?', 'No. Use the SDK in your own screens. The NULL web app is a reference integration. You provide authentication, wallet connection, authorization and encrypted recovery.'],
  ['Can I use it with React, Next.js or another framework?', 'Yes. The SDK is framework-independent ESM with TypeScript declarations. Preparation works in Node.js 22.16+. Instantiate the browser proof client and access IndexedDB only on the client in SSR apps. Verify your bundler emits the proof worker and WASM assets.'],
  ['Does preparing a payout send money?', 'No. Resolution and preparation create an encrypted draft. Funding, owner authorization, proof preparation, recovery backup and transaction submission are separate steps.'],
  ['Why does an ordinary .eth name fail?', 'The current high-level API requires a supported Sepolia ENSv2 resolver and a valid NULL payment-profile record. Owning a name on mainnet is not enough. Confirm the resolved destination before preparing the payout.'],
  ['Can I send to a wallet address instead?', 'New distributions in the high-level SDK require confirmed ENS names. A wallet address is used separately for public withdrawals. Name expiry does not prevent recovery, claims or withdrawals.'],
  ['What happens if a request times out?', 'Preserve the operation and encrypted checkpoint, then reconcile. A timeout or not-observed result does not prove failure. Do not resend or fall back to another wallet while the result is unknown.'],
  ['Can I pay more than eight people?', 'Yes. PayoutJob partitions a larger list into sequential batches of up to eight. Each batch has separate authorization, proof and receipt. Earlier batches can succeed while later ones stop. The job is not an atomic transaction or durable background queue.'],
  ['Can recipients withdraw only part of their funds?', 'The recorded public v0.2 pool supports whole-note exits. Partial withdrawals with private change require the new v0.3 pool and matching artifacts, currently verified locally. Changing a flag cannot upgrade the immutable v0.2 pool.'],
  ['Will logging in restore a recipient’s money?', 'Authentication does not restore NULL keys. Keep an encrypted identity backup and encrypted funds checkpoints. Fresh private-change secrets need the updated checkpoint; original identity keys alone are insufficient.'],
  ['Does this hide who paid and how much?', 'The allocation amount and specific source distribution stay out of claim public inputs. Public deposits, withdrawals, transaction senders and timing can still reveal connections. v0.2 full-note exits expose the note amount. The current release cannot guarantee payer unlinkability or amount anonymity.'],
  ['Is sponsored gas free?', 'Someone pays: the connected wallet, your organization or your sponsor backend. Sponsorship does not fund the USDC payout or replace owner authorization. Initial funding-wallet approval and deposit remain separate.'],
  ['Is this ready for production or other chains?', 'This release is an unaudited testnet preview for the configured Sepolia deployment and local testing. No production security, anonymity, throughput or fee guarantee is claimed. CRE evidence is local simulation; the complete Privy owner-approved financial demonstration remains outstanding.'],
